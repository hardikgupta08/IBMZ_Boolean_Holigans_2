# FooodLink : Share Food, Reduce Waste, And Fight Hunger

## Abstract:
#### In contemporary urban environments, the dual challenges of excessive food waste and persistent hunger disparities pose profound issues for both the economy and social equity. Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) underscore the necessity of addressing these critical concerns. The proposed solution outlines a comprehensive approach to rectify the existing problem by leveraging a web-based application with API integration, serving as a bridge between food providers, such as restaurants and grocery stores with surplus inventory, and local food banks and shelters. The current problem is rooted in the inefficiencies in matching surplus food supplies with the most vulnerable individuals in urban settings. Food waste is a significant contributor to environmental degradation, and simultaneously, many urban residents remain food-insecure. This scenario necessitates a solution that promotes responsible consumption and addresses hunger disparities. This solution thus capitalizes on API-based geolocation services to offer a streamlined and scalable web application. Users can readily post information about their excess food supplies, and the platform, based on the user's current location, will identify and display nearby food banks and shelters. This strategy not only minimizes food wastage but also enhances the accessibility of surplus food resources for those in need. By focusing on an API-driven web application, the approach optimizes the delivery of surplus food to the target beneficiaries, thereby contributing substantially to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 12. Moreover, the technical foundations of this platform provide a sustainable solution to address food waste and hunger in urban areas while facilitating data-driven monitoring and assessment for continualÂ improvement.
